# RPL Final Project

StudApp is a website project that aims to enhance student productivity by providing a comprehensive set of features in one place. The application includes five main components: a habit tracker, finance tracker, gratitude tracker, to-do list, and quotes generator.

The project was developed using a variety of programming languages, including Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To facilitate the creation and development of the StudApp website, the Django framework was also utilized.

By using StudApp, students can easily keep track of their daily habits, finances, and to-do lists, as well as develop a positive mindset through gratitude and inspirational quotes. The application is user-friendly and offers a visually appealing interface that is easy to navigate.
